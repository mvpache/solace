# Discussion

## Instructions
1. Fix any glaring bugs and anti patterns.
2. Improve the design UI/UX to make the experience better for prospective patients. We value design heavily at Solace so feel free to flex your skills in this area. The repo is set up with tailwind but feel free to use any styling framework youâ€™d like.
3. Consider both frontend and backend performance improvements. Assume we have a database of hundreds of thousands of advocates we need to search through.
